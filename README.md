# Fingerprint Scanner Box ðŸ”’

This repository contains the final report and resources for an Arduino-based **Fingerprint Scanner Box** project, designed and fabricated at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu)'s [TechSpark](https://engineering.cmu.edu/techspark/index.html) makerspace. The total cost of manufacturing the prototype was \$ 32.81 from a total allocated budget of \$ 50.00.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Overview

The Fingerprint Scanner Box is a secure enclosure featuring:
- A capacitive fingerprint sensor mounted on a slanted surface for ergonomic access
- LED indicators (Red, Green, Blue) for status feedback
- Arduino UNO R3 integration for fingerprint enrollment, recognition, and deletion
- Custom CAD design and 3D printed components
- Laser-cut plywood construction with CMU branding

## ðŸ›  Technologies & Tools Used

- Arduino UNO R3 + IDE
- Capacitive Fingerprint Sensor
- SolidWorks (CAD)
- Dremel 3D40 (3D Printing)
- Epilog Mini (Laser Cutting)
- PLA filament, wood glue, resistors, jumper cables
